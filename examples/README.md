Conbo.js Examples
=================

This folder contains a selection of basic examples to get you started with
Conbo.js, including:

* **HelloWorld**: As the name suggests.
* **ContextAndInjection**: Setting up your context and using in a basic pub-sub setup.
* **Binding**: Data binding example showing the property of a model bound to multiple HTML elements which are automatically updated in real-time when the user edits the content of an input field.
* **ParseFunctions**: Builds on the data binding example by showing how a bound property can be parsed in real-time before being displayed. In this example we format a user input number as a currency.
* **Namespaces**: Demonstrates how to automatically apply Application and View classes to existing DOM elements using a namespace
* **Prefixes**: Demonstrates the use of a prefix to specify which existing DOM elements should have Application and View classes automatically applied to them
